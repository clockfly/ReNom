Introduction
=============

ReNomDL(version3) is a Deep Learning frame work.


Concept of ReNom version 3
---------------------------

The goal of ReNomDL version 3.0 is to allow users implement a high performance neural network.
So far, many deep learning frame works are provided from many vendors. However many of frame works 
requires users programming skills. The training time and inference time is depends on users programming skill
that are including cuda programming, parallel computing and so on.

ReNomDL has functions to optimize user defined neural networks. This allows users high speed and scalable training.


High Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ReNomDL allows you to implement neural networks that are high performance at training speed and less gpu mempry.
